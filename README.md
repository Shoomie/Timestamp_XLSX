A time logging program that logs your effective time by:

1. Opening an xlsx file.
2. Inserting the start time on a new row in the A column.
3. When P is pressed, the end time is saved in the B column.
4. Calculates the elapsed time and saves the total into the C column.
5. Saves the file into the same folder as the EXE and exits.

Requires the Office package to run.
If no document exists, a new one named after the current year and month will be created.
The same applies when a new month starts. If time is logged across months, it will be saved in the file pertaining to the month when the logger was started.
Existing documents will have the newly logged time added to the next row.

The EXE-file can be found in the bin folder and is (or should be) portable on Windows.
